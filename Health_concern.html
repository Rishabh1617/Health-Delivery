        Vertigo (BPPV)</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 25px;">1}Explain to the patient that his symptoms of vertigo might be reproduced and that he
        might feel nauseaus. Have a bucket at hand in cases it is needed.</span>
        <br>
    <span style="font-size: 25px;">2} Have the patient sit on the treatment bench in long sit with a pillow on the table to
        make sure that the patient’s neck will come into 20° of extension at step 3.</span> 
    <br>   
    <span style="font-size: 25px;">3}The examiner rotates the patient’s head 45° towards the side to be tested
        the patient is instructed to keep his eyes open and the examiner takes the patient
        backwards in a quick movement so that the patient’s neck is still rotated 45° and the
        neck is brought into 20° extension.
        </span> 
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 25px;">4}The patient’s eyes are observed for the latency (typically 5-20s), duration and
        direction of a possible nystagmus. The nystagmus usually fatigues within 60 seconds.
        </span> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: 28px;font-weight: bold;">Positive Outcome:</span><span style="font-size: 25px;"> The patient experiences vertigo with an upbeat nystagmus

        <span style="font-size: 25px;">3}Slowly extend the elbow until the patient complains of familiar symptoms.
            </span> 
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 25px;">4}Confirm that the findings are due to nerve stretch by flexing the elbow a little to
            create slack and ask the patient to laterally flex their neck to the contralateral side,
            which should increase the symptoms again.
            </span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 28px;font-weight: bold;">Positive Outcome:</span><span style="font-size: 25px;">The patients familiar arm symptoms like shooting pain or
            paresthesia are reproduced. Some authors score the test negative in case of a marked
            decrease of mobility (>10°).</span>

            <br>
        <span style="font-size: 25px;">2}The examiner stabilizes the scapula with one hand and holds the patient’s affected
            arm at 90° abduction and internal rotation.</span> 
        <br>   
        <span style="font-size: 25px;">3}Then the examiner applies a longitudinal force through the humerus at the elbow and
            moves the arm into horizontal adduction.
            </span> 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-size: 28px;font-weight: bold;">Positive Outcome:</span><span style="font-size: 25px;"> Patient experiences sudden onset of posterior shoulder
            pain and a click in the shoulder. A painful response is also a predictor of failure for
            conservative treatment.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;">~A1C Test</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">The A1C test measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2 or 3 months. An A1C below 5.7% is normal, between 5.7 and 6.4% indicates you have prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates you have diabetes.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;"> ~Fasting Blood Sugar Test</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">This measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating). A fasting blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL or lower is normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;"> ~Glucose Tolerance Test</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">This measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward. At 2 hours, a blood sugar level of 140 mg/dL or lower is considered normal, 140 to 199 mg/dL indicates you have prediabetes, and 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;"> ~Random Blood Sugar Test</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">This measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You can take this test at any time and don’t need to fast (not eat) first. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates you have diabetes.If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, your blood may also tested for autoantibodies (substances that indicate your body is attacking itself) that are often present in type 1 diabetes but not in type 2 diabetes. You may have your urine tested for ketones (produced when your body burns fat for energy), which also indicate type 1 diabetes instead of type 2 diabetes.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;"> ~Glucose Screening Test</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">This measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You’ll drink a liquid that contains glucose, and then 1 hour later your blood will be drawn to check your blood sugar level. A normal result is 140 mg/dL or lower. If your level is higher than 140 mg/dL, you’ll need to take a glucose tolerance test.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;"> ~Glucose Tolerance Test</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">This measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward. Results can differ depending on the size of the glucose drink and how often your blood sugar is tested. Ask your doctor what your test results mean.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 52px;padding-left: 40px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;"> ~Gestational Diabetes</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 25px;padding-left: 40px;">Gestational diabetes is diagnosed using blood tests. You’ll probably be tested between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. If your risk is higher for getting gestational diabetes (due to having more risk factors), your doctor may test you earlier. Blood sugar that’s higher than normal early in your pregnancy may indicate you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes rather than gestational diabetes.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Electrocardiogram (ECG)</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">An ECG reads your heart’s electrical impulses. It shows how well your heart is beating.

                Small sticky dots and wire leads are put on your chest, arms and legs. The leads are attached to an ECG machine which records the electrical impulses and prints them out on paper.
                
                Your doctor may use an ECG to diagnose a heart attack or abnormal heart rhythms (called ‘arrhythmias’).</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Echocardiogram (ultrasound)</span>
                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">An echocardiogram is a common test. It gives a picture of your heart using ultrasound, a type of X-ray. It uses a probe either on your chest or down your oesophagus (throat).

                It helps your doctor check if there are any problems with your heart’s valves and chambers, and see how strongly your heart pumps blood.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Nuclear cardiac Stress Test</span>
                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">This test is sometimes called an ‘exercise thallium scan’, a ‘dual isotope treadmill’ or an ‘exercise nuclear scan’.

                A radioactive substance called a ‘tracer’ is injected into your bloodstream. It goes to your heart and releases energy. Special cameras take a picture of this energy from outside your body.
                
                Your doctor uses this picture to see how much blood flows to your heart muscle and how well your heart pumps blood when you are resting and doing physical activity. This test also helps your doctor to see if your heart muscle is damaged.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">An MRI uses very strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your heart on a computer. It can take still or moving pictures of your heart. Sometimes a special dye is used to make parts of the heart and coronary arteries easier to see.

                This test shows your doctor the structure of your heart and how well it is working, so they can decide the best treatment for you.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">This is a specialised type of computed tomography (CT) scan that may be used to help diagnose coronary artery disease. It is a non-invasive test for people who may be experiencing unusual cardiac symptoms.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Coronary angiogram</span>
                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">A coronary angiogram, sometimes called ‘cardiac catheterisation’, may be done after a heart attack or angina.

                A catheter (a small tube) is put into an artery in your groin, arm or wrist. The catheter is moved up inside the artery until it reaches your heart.
                
                A special dye is injected into your coronary arteries and an X-ray is taken.
                
                The X-ray shows your doctor where and how much your coronary arteries are clogged or blocked. It also shows how well your heart is pumping. Coronary angiograms help your doctor decide the best treatment for you.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Blood Pressure</span>
                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Have your blood pressure checked every 2 years if it is normal, you are aged under 40 years, and there is no family history of high blood pressure. Have it checked yearly if you are over 40, your blood pressure is on the high side, or you have a personal or family history of high blood pressure, stroke or heart attack. Be advised by your doctor.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Blood Test</span>
                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Check cholesterol levels and blood triglycerides, among other things. High levels may indicate an increased risk of various health problems, including heart disease. If you are over 45, you should have these blood tests once every 5 years. If you are at high risk of heart disease and have a family history, you should be tested every year from the age of 40.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">being overweight is a significant risk factor for many health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Ask your doctor to check your body mass index (BMI) and waist measurement every 2 years. If you are at a higher risk, you should have your weight checked more frequently.
                Anyone 45 years and over, or 30 years and over for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, should have a regular heart health check with their doctor. A heart health check is a 20-minute check-up with your GP to assess your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Heart health checks are covered by Medicare and are free at practices that bulk bill this service.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Eyesight tends to deteriorate with age. Serious eye conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration are more common with age.

                People older than 65 years should have an annual examination. However, more frequent testing may be recommended for those with certain risk factors, such as:
                
                a family history of eye disease
                a personal history of eye disease or injury
                certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes
                taking certain medications.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Advancing age is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis in both men and women. A bone density test helps to determine the health of your bones. Generally speaking, people over the age of 50 should be assessed for the need to have a bone density test.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">If you are sexually active, you should get tested for chlamydia every year between the ages of 15 and 29, using a simple urine test. Chlamydia is very common and does not always show symptoms.

                If you are at risk of other sexually transmissible infections, such as HIV/AIDS or herpes, ask your doctor about further testing.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">It is the most common cancer affecting Australian women. It can occur at any age, but it is more common in women over 60.

                Breast screening (also known as mammogram) is one of the best ways to detect breast cancer early. If breast cancer is found early, it is more likely to be successfully treated and improve your chance of surviving it.BreastScreen Australia invites women aged 50 to 74 for free mammograms every 2 years. If you are in your 40s or over 75, discuss the risks and benefits of screening with your doctor. Women under 40 are not eligible for the screening program.

                It is important that at any age, if you notice any breast symptoms or a change in the look and feel of your breast to see your doctor without delay.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Having regular cervical screening tests can help prevent cervical cancers through early detection and treatment.

                Cervical cancer screening is recommended every 5 years for women and people with a cervix who are aged 25 to 74 years and have ever been sexually active.
                
                The cervical screening test (which replaced the pap test) checks for the presence of the human papilloma virus – a virus that can cause cervical cancer. Even if you have been vaccinated against HPV, regular cervical screening is still important as the vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV infection.</span>

                <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">You should have a general check-up before becoming pregnant to discuss any health risks during pregnancy. Once you are pregnant, regular antenatal checks help monitor your baby’s development, pick up abnormalities and assess your health.

                Tests related to pregnancy may include ultrasound scans, urine tests, blood tests and genetic testing. Some antenatal tests are recommended for all pregnant women, while others are only necessary for women at increased risk of complications. Be advised by your doctor.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">The term "arthritis" covers more than 100 diseases and conditions affecting joints, the surrounding tissues, and other connective tissues, such as tendons and ligaments. Arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions include:

                Osteoarthritis,
                Rheumatoid Arthritis,
                Gout,

                Pain
                Aching or stiffness in or around a joint within the past 30 days
                Pain, aches and stiffness that has been present for 3 or more months</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs. In New York State (NYS), more than 1.4 million adults have asthma. Asthma occurs at any age but is more common in children than adults. Nationally, nearly one in 13 school-age children have asthma, and that rate is rising more rapidly in preschool-aged children and those living in urban inner cities than in any other group. Although there is no cure for asthma, asthma attacks can be prevented and controlled with proper care. New York is actively working with health care providers, community coalitions, schools, families and many others to fight asthma so people with asthma can live a full and active life.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Cancer is a group of more than 100 different diseases that begin when abnormal cells in the body grow out of control. Normally, cells grow and divide to create new cells as they are needed to keep the body healthy. Sometimes this process of growing new cells does not work properly and cancer forms.Normal cells become cancer cells because of damage to DNA. DNA is in every cell and directs all its actions. In a normal cell, when DNA gets damaged, the cell either repairs the damage or it dies. In cancer cells, the damaged DNA is not fixed, but the cell does not die like it should. Instead, this cell goes on making new cells that the body does not need.Abnormal cells can grow into a mass, or tumor. Not all tumors are cancerous. Tumors can be either malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). A malignant tumor, or cancer, can spread to other parts of the body and form other tumors.

                Some cancers, like leukemia, rarely form tumors. Instead, these cancer cells are in the blood and blood-forming organs and flow through other tissues, where they grow.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Diabetes is a chronic disease in which blood sugar (glucose) levels are above normal. The rate of new cases of diagnosed diabetes in the United States has begun to fall, but the numbers are still very high. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) is working to reverse the diabetes epidemic in New York State by focusing on diabetes prevention, identifying people with prediabetes, and collecting data on prevalence of diabetes to help improve the health of all people with diabetes.An estimated 1.58 million New York State adults report being diagnosed with diabetes (10.3%)
                The percentage of New York State adults who have diabetes increased from 6.3% in 2000 to 10.3% in 2020</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in New York State and across the nation. While many epidemics can be defeated with a pill or a vaccine, preventing or reversing obesity requires changes in policies, systems, and environments to support healthy behavior including access to affordable, nutritious foods and opportunities for physical activity in the places where people live, learn, eat, shop, work and play. Creating communities that support healthy food and beverage choices and safe and accessible physical activity opportunities, while also increasing efforts to reduce health disparities and inequities, is a major goal in the effort to prevent and reduce the burden of chronic diseases as part of the New York State Prevention Agenda 2019-2024. Maintaining healthy weight should start in early childhood and continue throughout adulthood.

                Obesity and overweight are currently the second leading preventable cause of death in the United States and may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death. Obesity is also associated with impaired immune function, decreased lung capacity, and increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 potentially tripling the risk of hospitalization due to a COVID-19 infection, and as body mass index (BMI) increases, the risk of death from COVID-19 increases. Obesity also disproportionately impacts specific racial and ethnic minority groups, including Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic adults who have higher prevalence of obesity and are more likely to experience worse outcomes from COVID-19.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to become thin and weak, often resulting in fractures (broken bones). Fractures can cause debilitating pain, reduced mobility, and a loss of quality of life.

                The October 2004 release of "Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Report of the Surgeon General" called for state health departments to join forces with the private sector and community organizations in a coordinated, collaborative effort to promote healthy bones.
                
                Osteoporosis education is the key to helping you make choices necessary to achieve healthy bones and overall wellness for a lifetime. In 1997, the New York State Public Health Law 2707 (Osteoporosis Education Bill) established the New York State Osteoporosis Prevention Education Program (NYSOPEP) within the New York State Department of Health. This educational initiative makes it possible for all New Yorkers (the public and healthcare providers) to learn about the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to several types of disease that involve the heart and blood vessels. CVD includes coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure and other conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels.

                Heart Disease is a term that refers to several types of heart conditions which include CHD, valves in the heart, and congestive heart failure. The most common type of heart disease is CHD. CHD occurs when a substance called plaque builds up that narrows the arteries in the heart. A heart attack occurs when an artery becomes completely blocked, resulting in a lack of blood flow to the heart. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States and in New York State.

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a group of serious lung diseases. COPD includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema and some types of asthma. In COPD, less air flows through the tubes (called airways) to and from the lungs, which makes it hard to breathe. Although there is no cure for COPD, it often can be prevented or managed.

                COPD is a major cause of disability and death in the U.S.1 Chronic lower respiratory diseases, which includes COPD, are the third leading cause of death in the U.S.2 Of these diseases, COPD causes more than 95 percent of the deaths.1
                
                About 15.7 million adults living in the U.S. have been diagnosed with COPD, although millions more may have COPD and not know it.1,3 In New York State, over 900,000 adults have been diagnosed with COPD.4</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Changing your diet can help with the reduction of discomfort along with regulating your menstrual cycle. Adding foods rich in vitamin C such as citrus to your meals, along with iron rich foods such as spinach, chard and other leafy greens, can help to prevent anemia. These help to prevent anemia by providing iron to help produce more red blood cells.

                You can also drink more water, which will increase your body’s hydration to prevent problems with blood clots during menstruation. Lastly, drinking sports drinks, in moderation, can help improve electrolyte levels in your blood.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Although pregnancy is a joyful experience for many women, it can also elicit feelings of fear, anxiety and even depression. In fact, research shows that about 7 percent of women experience some level of depression during pregnancy.Depression is a mood disorder that can result in feelings of sadness, hopelessness and a loss of interest in activities the person normally enjoys. People with depression may find it difficult to complete everyday tasks or provide adequate care for themselves.While the exact cause of depression is still unknown, doctors believe that chemical imbalances in the brain and fluctuating hormone levels may be contributing factors. Some hormones are thought to affect the parts of the brain that control emotions.

                Genetics may also play a role, as depression is more common in people who have family members with depression.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">The pill releases hormones that prevent egg production from occurring in the ovaries. These hormones also thicken the cervical mucous so that sperm can't get through to join with an egg, if one were to be released. There are two forms of the pill: the combination pill, which contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, and the mini pill (also called the progestin-only pill), which contains only progestin. Most women on the pill use a combination pill.

                The progestin pill is good for women who are having side effects from the combination pill; it's also good for women who have just begun to breastfeed, since estrogen can limit milk production.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Late Period</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">After puberty, you should notice that your period starts to come each month with some regularity. While your average cycle might vary by a few days from one month to another, you might notice that it occurs late.

                The occasional odd cycle is nothing to be alarmed by, but realizing that this month’s start date somehow managed to fly by with no sign of your period coming can generate some major anxiety.
                
                Taking a pregnancy test is most women’s initial reaction when they have a late period, but a negative test often reveals far more questions than answers. Your period is regulated by a complicated balance of hormones, and there are many completely natural (and harmless) things that can throw it off.
                
                When you find yourself staring at the calendar with anxiety, or taking multiple pregnancy tests that turn out negative, knowing what to do when your periods are late can help you figure out your best course of action.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Pregnancy is a beautiful experience, but also challenging. Many women go through their fair share of joys and hardships during this unique time as they prepare to bring their little one into the big world. Although motherhood is a special and uplifting experience, many women struggle with an undesired side-effect of pregnancy: stretch marks.

                Every woman has different feelings about their bodies after they experience new physical changes in their lives. Along with new responsibilities and demands at home post-delivery, a woman’s body is still recovering from pregnancy and labor. During this period, some women feel insecure about the way they look.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) occurs due to a reproductive hormone imbalance that can create ovary problems. In a healthy menstrual cycle, ovaries release an egg every month during ovulation. When the egg isn’t fertilized, it’s expelled from a woman’s body a couple of weeks later during her period.

                PCOS can disrupt this process by preventing a woman’s ovaries from releasing an egg during ovulation. PCOS causes the ovaries to produce an unusually high amount of male sex hormones (androgens) that are normally only present in small amounts in women.
                
                A high level of androgens triggers menstrual cycle problems and prevents a woman’s body from making enough hormones for ovulation. PCOS can make periods irregular or stop altogether, often making conception more difficult.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 45px;font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;padding-left: 40px;">~Fertility Awareness Methods</span>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: 26px;padding-left: 40px;">Fertility awareness methods, or FAMs, make it easier for women to prevent or plan pregnancy by tracking their fertility. These methods are sometimes known as “natural family planning” or the “rhythm method.” They are, unfortunately, the least effective of all popular contraceptive approaches.

                When you use FAMs, you will know when ovulation (when your ovaries release an egg each month) occurs. You are most likely to get pregnant closer to ovulation, which is the time when you are most fertile.
                
                Using a fertility awareness method allows you to use a barrier birth control method like condoms or abstaining from sex on the days you are most fertile. One of the advantages of using FAMs is that different approaches can be practical and the methods can be stopped anytime, unlike permanent birth control.</span>
